# Secret Naming Convention

The naming convention detailed below is also defined in [ADR-020](../adrs/adr-020.html) where it specifically relates to the namin of
GitHub Personal Access Tokens in the bot account. However the required properties of the name apply to any secret created.

The naming convention consists of three parts which should ensure uniqueness; `<business_domain>_<usage>_<permission_type>`

- **Business domain**; this should succintly describe the business domain or blobbum for which the token is created.
For example, `DORMANT_USERS`, `DNS`, `JOIN_GITHUB`.
- **Usage**; this should describe the intended use of the token within the given business domain. For example,
  - When used for everything in the business domain; `GENERAL`
  - When used for a specific tool or integration; `SENTRY`, `SLACK`, `GITHUB`, `TERRAFORM`.
- **Permission type**; this should indicate the amount of power the token wields. For example,
`ADMIN`, `WRITE`, `READ` are clear and sufficient. 

Examples,

- `DORMANT_USERS_SLACK_ADMIN`
- `DNS_OCTODNS_WRITE` 
- `JOIN_GITHUB_FLASK_ADMIN`
- `OPS_ENG_GENERAL_ADMIN`
