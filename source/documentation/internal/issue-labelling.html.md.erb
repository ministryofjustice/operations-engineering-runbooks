# Issue Labelling

## Purpose

This runbook sets out our approach for labelling Issues.

[Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) is a feature that
makes it easier to understand more about an Issue at a glance. They are also a good way of sorting or filtering Issues.

A story type Issue will typically have 4 labels assigned to it:

**Product/Service** - This identifies which product or service the story relates to e.g. `GitHub`

**Workflow Status** - This identifies where an Issue is in our delivery workflow and helps the team know if a story can
be worked on or not e.g. `Needs Refining` (i.e. the story is not yet ready to be worked on).

**MoSCoW Priority** - This helps identify priority using
the [MoSCoW system](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/moscow-prioritization/#:~:text=The%20acronym%20MoSCoW%20represents%20four,MoSCoW%20to%20mean%20%E2%80%9Cwish.%E2%80%9D).
This label will normally be agreed during Backlog Refinement or Planning e.g. `Must Have` (i.e. mandatory user need)

**Type of Activity** - This indicates the principle type of work that the story might involve e.g. `Documentation` (e.g.
the story is for creating a runbook)

**Language** - Idetifies coding language required to complete this story. Only applies to `Development` "Type" stories

**Type of Work** - Identifies the [type of work](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CPVD6398C/p1695132022778289) so that
we ensure that our sprints are balanced, and check that our team focus is not on one type of work e.g. we focusing on
lots of new features and projects and don't spend any time addressing technical debt.

## Exceptions

**GitHub Feature Requests** - These are automatically updated with the `feature request`, `github` and `third party`
labels.
