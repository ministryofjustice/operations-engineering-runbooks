# Responding to Dependency Alerts

If a vulnerability is identified by the CVE scanning process, the following steps should be taken to mitigate:

- Create a ticket relating to the vulnerability on the Github Projects board and add it to the current sprint. 

- Check to see if a patched version of the software exists using available documentation. 

- If a patched version of the software exists, patch the vulnerability and rerun the daily check.

- If a patched version of the software doesn't exist, conduct further investigation into the vulnerability and communicate with the team for further escalation.
