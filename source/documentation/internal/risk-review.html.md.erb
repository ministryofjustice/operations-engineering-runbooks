# Risk Review Meeting Process

This runbook outlines the process for conducting a risk review meeting for the Operations Engineering team. The risk review meeting is a recurring meeting where the team reviews the risk register and discusses any changes or updates.

## Frequency

- **Suggested Frequency:** Monthly.

## Pre-Meeting Preparation

1. Ensure the risk register is updated with the latest information.
2. Assign team members to review specific risks or sections of the risk register in advance.
3. Create an agenda based on the updated risk register and any new risks identified since the last meeting.

## Participants

- Operations Engineering Team Members
- Any Stakeholder or Subject Matter Expert relevant to specific risks

## Using the Risk Register

- **Access and Familiarity:** Ensure all participants have [access](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Qw1wbciWaHQPC54gJg2CFaNvMDKRRXJqRS3EE8h-ME/edit?usp=sharing) to and are familiar with the risk register.
- **Structure:** The risk register includes columns for Risk ID, Description, Likelihood, Impact, Risk Score, Mitigation Strategy, Owner, and Review Date.
- **Updating Information:** During the meeting, update the risk register in real-time to reflect discussions, decisions, and changes.
- **Risk Scoring:** Use the Likelihood and Impact scores to calculate the Risk Score, which helps in prioritising risks.
- **Review Dates:** Pay special attention to risks with overdue review dates, as highlighted by the conditional formatting in the register.
- **Actionable Insights:** Focus discussions on actionable insights and decisions that affect the risk register entries.

### 3. Discussion and Analysis (15-20 min)

Discuss emerging trends or patterns in the risk register and analyse the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies.

### 4. Action Items and Assignments (10 min)

## Post-Meeting Actions

2. Share the meeting minutes, including action items and deadlines, with all participants and relevant stakeholders.
3. Ensure follow-up on assigned actions and prepare for interim reviews if needed.

## Additional Tips
