# Firebreak Sprints

This page outlines the concept of firebreak sprints, incorporating insights from the [GOV.UK team's approach](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/) to effectively using time for innovation, technical health and team well-being. The goal is to ensure our software development process's long-term health and efficiency through a structured break from the regular sprint cycle.

## What is a Firebreak Sprint

A firebreak sprint, inspired by the practice on GOV.UK, is a planned break intended to focus on improving the codebase, exploring new technologies and working on innovations. Similar to Google's 20% time or Spotify's hack week, it's a chance for the team to tackle projects outside the regular sprint work, serving as a preventive measure against technical debt and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Why Firebreak Sprints Are Important

Following the rationale provided by GOV.UK, firebreak sprints offer essential benefits:

### 🧪 **Innovation**

They provide an opportunity for staff to pursue work that interests them, potentially bringing significant value to the project.

### 📈 **Recharging**

This period allows teams to pause and recharge, preventing burnout and maintaining high productivity.

### 🧠 **Transition**

Acts as a natural breakpoint for teams to wind down from old tasks and prepare for new ones, ensuring smoother transitions and reducing the impact of disruptive tasks.

## Frequency of Firebreak Sprints

- Firebreak sprints should be scheduled once every four sprints, aligning with the idea that regular breaks are crucial for sustained innovation and productivity.

- Each firebreak sprint lasts the same duration as regular sprints, typically two weeks, allowing enough time for meaningful work without derailing ongoing project timelines.

## Using GitHub Discussions for Firebreak Sprints

To emulate the open and collaborative spirit of firebreaks as seen on GOV.UK, GitHub Discussions is utilised to propose, discuss and vote on ideas.

### ⏳ Prerequisites

- Ensure all team members have a GitHub account with access to the repository.

- Encourage familiarity with creating and participating in GitHub Discussions for a smooth proposal process.

### 🗣️ Creating a Firebreak Discussion

1. Navigate to the [Operations Engineering GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/operations-engineering/discussions) repository and click on the "Discussions" tab.
2. Start a new discussion, choosing a relevant category and clearly titling the discussion to reflect its purpose, such as proposing firebreak sprint projects.
3. Encourage team members to submit their ideas following a structured format that includes the project's goal, value, and required skills or resources. Post a comment on a Slack channel to notify the team of the new discussion.

### 📝 Contributing Ideas and Voting

- Team members contribute by posting comments with their project proposals

- Ideas are voted on, with the most supported or critical tasks identified by the PM for inclusion in the firebreak sprint

## 📖 Sprint Planning with Firebreak Insights

- Inspired by GOV.UK, the sprint planning meeting for the firebreak sprint introduces relevant GitHub Discussions

- Decisions on task prioritisation are made collectively, based on the discussion outcomes and the project's needs

## Reference to the GOV.UK Firebreak Approach
