## To add a new runbook

- Create a new `*.html.md.erb` file in the `source/documentation/<subdirectory>` directory of this repository, containing the runbook information
- Add a corresponding list item in the `source/index.html.md.erb` file

> The link target should be `runbooks/documentation/<subdirectory>/[filename].html` i.e. if the runbook file is `source/documentation/certificates/foobar.html.md.erb` then the link target should be `runbooks/certificates/foobar.html`

- Raise and merge a PR to add your changes to the `main` branch of this repository
