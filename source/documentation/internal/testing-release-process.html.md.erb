# Testing and Release Process 

This runbook outlines the risk-aware process for testing and releasing changes to third party tools (e.g Github) to increase reliability and minimise disruptions for users.

## Step 1: Risk Assessment and Planning 

- **Conduct a Full Risk Assessment:** Ensure a thorough risk assessment for all affected user groups, treating each as an equal stakeholder.
- **Include Stakeholders:**  Engage key stakeholders earlier in the release process to discuss the potential impact on users and the functionalities affected by the change. 

## Step 2: Testing Process 

-  **Define Testing Criteria:** Ensure that testing covers all user groups, user types (existing, new) and all user access methods (web UI, CLI).
-  **Create and Document Test Cases:** Create a spreadsheet covering functional and non-functional testing requirements based on the criteria. 
-  **Conduct Testing:** Use a testing environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Include a variety of user types. 
-  **Document Testing Results:** Record the test results in the test spreadsheet and share them with the team for review and discussion. 

## Step 3: Commununication and User Notification 

-  **Allow a Minimum 24-hour Delay:** Ensure there is at least a 24-hour gap between the release of the change and the communication. 
-  **Inform Users and Stakeholders:** Notify users and support teams about the planned release, including a summary of expected changes, potential impacts, and support contacts.

## Step 4 Release and Monitoring

- **Obtain Dual Approval:** Ensure two separate approvals are received in Slack from the team members before proceeding with the release.
- **Execute Release:** Implement the change according to the release plan, following the successful completion of all preceding steps.
- **Post-Release Monitoring:** Monitor affected systems and user feedback channels to quickly address any issues that may arise.
- **Incident Process for Issues:** If a significant issue occurs, follow the [incident response](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/internal/incident-response.html) runbook to notify the team and begin problem resolution.
