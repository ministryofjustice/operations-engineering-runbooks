# Ways of Working

This document serves as our collaborative playbook, providing clear guidelines and standardised processes for how we
work together. It ensures consistency, clarity, and efficiency in our daily tasks, fostering a harmonious team culture.
By referring to this document, we align ourselves toward common goals, resolve conflicts, and adapt to changing needs.
It's not just a set of rules; it's a tool for continuous improvement, helping us evolve and excel as a team.

**Statuses:**

- âœ… Accepted
- ðŸ§ª Experimenting
- ðŸ’¡ New idea (waiting to be discussed by the team)

## **Delivery**

### **âœ… We Update Stories With Progress**

To keep everyone in the loop and maintain transparency, it's crucial to update the status of your assigned stories
regularly. Whether it's a small task or a significant milestone, updating the stories with your progress ensures
everyone knows where we stand and how we're moving forward.

### **âœ… We Use 2-Week Sprints**

2-week sprints have been accepted as a reasonable time frame to balance the need for the team to deliver complex work
items, and the need to include reflective practices such as demos, retrospectives, sprint planning frequently.

## **Ceremonies**

### **âœ… Backlog Refinement**

These sessions enable us to review, prioritise, and adapt our tasks. By fine-tuning upcoming work items, we ensure
clarity and focus. Backlog refinement promotes effective planning, enabling us to address potential challenges in
advance. These sessions foster collaboration, empowering team members to contribute ideas and clarify doubts. Through
these targeted discussions, we maintain a well-organized backlog. Engaging in backlog refinement enhances our readiness
for future sprints.

### **âœ… Demos**

These sessions ensure transparency, collaboration, and rapid improvement. By showcasing completed work to stakeholders,
we align everyone with our progress and gather immediate feedback. This process fosters team pride and accountability.
Additionally, demos empower stakeholders with direct insights, enhancing their engagement. Through these efficient
sessions, we celebrate successes, pinpoint areas for growth, and pivot effectively for upcoming sprints, ensuring our
continuous development and team cohesion.

### **âœ… Retrospectives**

Retrospectives are pivotal in our team's evolution. These sessions, condensed and insightful, provide a dedicated space
for reflection, learning, and growth. By analyzing our recent sprint, we identify successes and challenges, enabling us
to celebrate achievements and address obstacles. Retrospectives foster open communication, empowering team members to
share ideas for improvement candidly. Through these focused discussions, we refine our strategies, enhance
collaboration, and fortify our team dynamics. Embracing retrospectives ensures our continuous adaptation and drives us
toward excellence in every sprint.

### **âœ… Risk Register Review**

These sessions provide a clear understanding of our current risks and serve as a platform to discuss both existing and
potential new challenges. By openly addressing these risks, we foster a team-wide awareness and encourage proactive
problem-solving. These discussions empower us to develop effective strategies, enhancing our preparedness and
adaptability. Our focus is not just on identifying problems but on finding collective solutions. Engaging in these
reviews ensures that our team is well-equipped to navigate uncertainties and make informed decisions with confidence.

### **âœ… Sprint Planning**

In these focused sessions, we outline our goals and tasks for the upcoming sprint. By defining clear objectives, we
foster team alignment and understanding. Sprint planning ensures that every team member comprehends their roles and
responsibilities, promoting accountability. These sessions allow us to optimize our efforts toward shared objectives. By
engaging in sprint planning, we enhance collaboration, refine our strategies, and set the stage for a successful sprint.
This meticulous planning guarantees our team's cohesion, enabling us to deliver high-quality work consistently.

### **âœ… Daily Stand-Up Meetings**

Our team holds daily stand-up meetings in the morning to improve communication and collaboration. This consistent timing
aligns everyone, allowing for timely updates and obstacle resolution. Morning meetings enable efficient daily planning,
ensuring tasks are in sync with team objectives. This proactive approach enhances productivity and teamwork, making our
Agile processes more effective.

### **âœ… If Unable to Attend Stand-Up, Post an Update in the Slack Channel**

If you cannot attend stand-up, post a brief update in the designated Slack channel. Sharing your progress, impediments,
and any help you need keeps the team informed and ensures we can support each other effectively, even when we're not
physically present.

### **âœ… We Walk the Board at Stand-Ups**

At our Stand-Up meetings, it's essential that everyone actively participates. We walk the board together, discussing the
tasks and their statuses. This shared understanding helps us identify bottlenecks, dependencies, and progress made. By
default, be ready to share your updates and actively engage in the discussion.

### **âœ… Stand-Down Reflections for Continuous Growth**

As we wrap up the day, let's take a moment in our Stand-Down thread to reflect and share. Post updates to celebrate
progress, voice frustrations to seek support, and highlight wins to spread joy. This transparency fosters teamwork and
growth.

- **Updates**: Please make sure to note what you've accomplished.
- **Frustrations**: Share any obstacles - remember, it's us against the problem.
- **Wins**: Let's cheer for our victories, big or small.

Stay constructive and kind.

### **âœ… Use Google Meet For Ceremonies**

To ensure we have stability and functionality required to run ceremonies effectively, we use Google Meets for Ceremonies
by default. Google Meet is familiar to the team and has been proved to provide most functionality required to run
meetings effectively, such as:

- Sharing individual tabs/apps instead of entire screen
- Quick reactions for instant feedback
- Easy to use hand-up facility for a better flow of conversation of topics
- Quality video streaming capabilities, so team members can have cameras enabled

### **ðŸ§ª Use Slack Huddles For Stand-Up**

To increase visibility of our daily updates, we use Slack Huddles to host stand-ups. Slack allows quick and efficient
stand-ups in a public space where our conversation can be saved and referenced later.

## General

### **âœ… Team Socialisation**

We aim to partake in team social days at least every 2 months to ensure a healthy work-life balance and encourage
camaraderie through activities outside. These days are essential for us to step back from work and strengthen our team
dynamics through shared, informal experiences. We also aim to include virtual activities where we can to help break up
some of the more ceremony-intense days.

For anyone wondering, Sam is currently the darts champion.<sup>[*citation needed*]</sup>

## Tools

### **âœ… We use GitHub Projects For Project Workflow Visualisation**

To increase visibility of our work in progress and to keep track/plan future work effectively, we uss GitHub projects.

GitHub Projects is a simple-to-use project management tool that integrates seamlessly with our code repositories, which
are already hosted in GitHub.

It allows to easily add custom fields and metrics to keep track of project management related meta-data for work items,
and create specialised views to optimise our ceremonies.

## Adding/Adjusting Ways of Working

Adding or adjusting our Ways of Working is a collaborative process. If you have a suggestion or think something needs to
change, raise a Pull Request to update the document! Feel free to discuss the change in our Slack channel or during our
Stand-Up. At latest, we'll discuss any changes during our Retrospective meetings. We value continuous improvement, so
your input is essential in shaping how we work together as a team.

### Experimental Ways of Working

As an innovative team, we're always exploring new methods to enhance our productivity and collaboration.

Remember, experiments are opportunities for us to learn and grow together. Your feedback and active participation are
vital in making these experiments successful.
