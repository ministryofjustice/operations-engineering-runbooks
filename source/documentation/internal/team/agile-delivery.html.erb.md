# Agile Delivery

A practical guide for Operations Engineering's Agile Delivery methodologies and practices.

The foundation of Operations Engineering's Agile Delivery is [Our Ways of Working](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/internal/team/ways-of-working.html), which should be read before reading this guide.

Many ideas in this guide are based on the following resources, which can be used as a reference or for further reading:

- [GDS Agile Delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery)
- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
- [Agile Manifesto - Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

## Introduction

Agile, by principle, rarely produces a _'one shoe fits all'_ solution for delivery and project management.

Operations Engineering has documented the teams' agreed approach below, enabling the process to be critically analysed and reflected upon later. This ensures continuos improvement to how projects are managed and services are delivered.

## Phases of Delivery

Detailed in the [GDS Agile Delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) guidance, there are 5 phases of a project:

- Discovery
- Alpha
- Beta
- Live
- Retirement

In this section, there will be a small summary of each phase, quickly followed by the specific details of how Operations Engineering approach the phase in the life cycle.

### Discovery

Detailed in [How the discovery phase works](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works), the discovery phase is all about understanding the problem.

**Primary Lifecycle Stages:** Planning, User Research, Data Gathering

### Alpha

Detailed in [How the alpha phase works](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works), the alpha phase is all about testing assumptions with users.

**Primary Lifecycle Stages:** Development, User Research, User Testing

### Beta

Detailed in [How the beta phase works](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works), the beta phase is all about starting to solve the problems.

**Primary Lifecycle Stages:** Development, Deployment, User Testing

### Live

Detailed in [How the beta phase works](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works), the live phase is all about supporting a service in a sustainable way.

**Primary Lifecycle Stages:** Maintenance, Monitoring

### Retirement

Detailed in [Retiring your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/retiring-your-service), the retirement phase is all about turning the service off.

**Primary Lifecycle Stages:** Monitoring, Decommissioning

## Types of Work

Loosely based on _The Four Types of Work (Phoenix Project)_

- Unplanned
- Tech Debt
- Experiment
- Project
  
## Lifecycle Stages

Loosely based on [The Systems Development Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle) and the [Project Management - Project Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management#Project_lifecycle)

- Planning
- User Research
- Data Gathering
- Development
- Deployment
- User Testing
- Monitoring
- Maintenance
- Decommissioning
