# Respond to leavers

The intention of this document is to give you an idea of what to do when you receive a notification that a user has left the organisation.

## What is a leaver?

A leaver is a user who has left the organisation.

## How will I know if a user has left the organisation?

Requests will come via the #ask-operations-engineering slack channel, or via email to the Operations Engineering Google Group. 

## What actions do I take?

### GitHub

If the user has a GitHub account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/people)
and the [MoJ Analytical Services organisation](https://github.com/orgs/moj-analytical-services/people).

At this point, it's a simple click ops exercise. You can do this by following the steps below:

- Log into GitHub

- Navigate to the organisation's 'people' page, for example [MoJ organisation](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/people)

- Use the search and select to remove the user from the organisation.

### Docker

If the user has a Docker account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/members).

### Sentry

If the user has a Sentry account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://ministryofjustice.sentry.io/settings/members/).

### Pingdom

If the user has a Pingdom account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://my.pingdom.com/app/3/home).

### PagerDuty

If the user has a PagerDuty account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/users).

### Auth0

If the user has an Auth0 account, you should remove them from the [MoJ organisation](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/eu/moj-uk/).

### 1Password

If the user has a [1Password](https://ministryofjustice.1password.eu/signin?landing-page=%2Fhome) account, you should remove them from the organisation.

## Communicate to the rest of the team

You should communicate your actions to the rest of the team. For example, if you have removed a user from GitHub, you should reply to the email thread and let the team know.
