# Register new `service.gov.uk` or `independent.gov.uk` subdomain

The purpose of this runbook is for the registration of `service.gov.uk` or `independent.gov.uk` subdomains e.g. `example.service.gov.uk` or `example.independent.gov.uk`.

MoJ is unable to regsiter these domains so must register these via Cabinet Office Domain Team.

## Pre-requisites

Before a Service Team can apply for a service.gov.uk subdomain it must have passed a [Beta Assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name#after-your-beta-assessment).

Evidence of passing the assessment must be provided with the request.

If a service has **not** passed Beta Assessment then a `service.justice.gov.uk` may be appropriate. See Register new justice.gov.uk or service.justice.gov.uk.

The above does not apply to `independent.gov.uk` subdomains.

As part of the process you will need to provide the following information to the Cabinet Office Domain Team as part of the request:
- Service name
- Short service description
- Details of the Service Owner
- Details of the Service Tech Lead
- Details of the Team/Squad running the project
- Name Servers details
- AWS account number where domain is hosted
- Hosted Zone ID

## Create NS Records

### DNS to be managed by Operations Engineering

1. [Created a new Hostedzone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html) in AWS Route53. This is a manual step via the AWS Console. NS records created here will be needed for the registration process in the next steps.

2. Add new Hostedzone to [DNS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dns).

### DNS to be delegated to another platform

1. If subdomain is being delegated to another platform ensure that the requester provides NS Record for where DNS will be managed e.g. Cloud Platform NS Records. This will be need for the registration process in the next steps.

## Submit registration request to CDDO

1. E-mail request for registration and delegation to Cabinet Office Domains Team at [domains@cabinetoffice.gov.uk](mailto:domains@cabinetoffice.gov.uk). Include pre-requisite information, and evidence of service passing Beta Assessment (if appropriate).

2. Cabinet Office will confirm when subdomain is registered and delegated.

3. Confirm to the Requester that the new subdomain has been registered.

After registration is complete any new DNS records for the new subdomain can be added by whoever is manageing that domain in MoJ.
