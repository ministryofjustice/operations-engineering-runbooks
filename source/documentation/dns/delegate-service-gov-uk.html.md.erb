# Delegation of an existing `service.gov.uk` subdomain

This runbook covers the process for delegation of an existing `service.gov.uk` subdomain. These domains are typically managed by CDDO so the request must be submitted to them for the delegation.

## Pre-requisites

- Request meets rules around [delegation](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/dns/domain-delegation.html)
- Domain **is not** managed via the [BT DNS](https://www.dmc.bt.com/) - If that is the case see runbook for delegation of `gov.uk` subdomains.
- New hosting provider has replicated existing DNS configuration.

## Submit delegation request to CDDO

1. E-mail request for delegation to CDDO domains team at [support@domains.gov.uk](mailto:support@domains.gov.uk). Include new NS record details.

2. CDDO will confirm when subdomain is delegated.

3. Confirm to the Requester that the subdomain has been delegated.

After delegation has fully propogated (depending on length of existing NS Record TTL) there may be the need to remove the existing hostedzone from [DNS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dns) and [delete the old Hostedzone](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/dns/how-to-delete-a-hostedzone.html).
