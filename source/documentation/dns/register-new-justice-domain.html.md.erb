# Register new `justice.gov.uk` or `service.justice.gov.uk` subdomain

The purpose of this runbook is for the registration of `justice.gov.uk` or `service.justice.gov.uk` subdomains.

However, we don't actually register these subdomains as we already have delegated management of those subdomains. This is actually creation of new subdomains in the existing Hostedzones i.e. creating a DNS record.

## Pre-requisites

- New requests for subdomains must meet the [MoJ domain naming standard](https://user-guide.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/domain-naming-standard.html).

- Requests where delegation is involved must adhere to our rules around [delegation](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/dns/domain-delegation.html).

## Create subdomain

This process follows the standard process for adding DNS records via [DNS](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dns).

Inform requester when changes have been completed.
