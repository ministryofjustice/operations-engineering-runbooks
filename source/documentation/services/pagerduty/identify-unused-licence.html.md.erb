# Identify Unused Pagerduty Licences

If running low on licences we can remove users who have not accepted an invite. You can use the [PagerDuty Onboarding Report](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/user-onboarding-report) to identify users who have never accpeted an invite.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

- PagerDuty Admin access

## User Onboarding Report

1. Navigate to the [User Onboarding Report](https://moj-digital-tools.pagerduty.com/analytics/dashboards/user-onboarding/P5OExfzET_QdUAcL1yI1Ng) (the report can be found under the Analytics tab).

2. Review report and identify users with a `Accepted Invite` value of `No`.

3. You can click on the users name from the report to access the users profile. Click on the **Delete** button to remove the user.

4. Repeat to free up as many licences as you can.
