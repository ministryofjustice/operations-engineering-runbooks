## Prerequisites

- Administrators permission on 1Password

1. Run the following commands to add permissions

```
export ADMIN_GROUP_NAME="Administrators"

# Get the UUID of the Administrators group
ADMIN_GROUP_UUID=$(op list groups | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "'$ADMIN_GROUP_NAME'") | .uuid')

# Get the UUIDs of the vaults that the Administrators group is part of
VAULT_UUIDS=$(op list vaults | jq -r '.[] | select(.groups[].uuid == "'$ADMIN_GROUP_UUID'") | .uuid')

# Grant export permissions to each vault
for VAULT_UUID in $VAULT_UUIDS; do
  op vault add $VAULT_UUID --permission=Export
done
```

2. Run the following commands to remove permissions

```
export ADMIN_GROUP_NAME="Administrators"

# Get the UUID of the Administrators group
ADMIN_GROUP_UUID=$(op list groups | jq -r '.[] | select(.name == "'$ADMIN_GROUP_NAME'") | .uuid')

# Get the UUIDs of the vaults that the Administrators group is part of
VAULT_UUIDS=$(op list vaults | jq -r '.[] | select(.groups[].uuid == "'$ADMIN_GROUP_UUID'") | .uuid')

# Remove export permissions from each vault
for VAULT_UUID in $VAULT_UUIDS; do
  op vault remove $VAULT_UUID --permission=Export
done
```
