# Alternative ways to share vaults and passwords

## Purpose

This runbook provides guidance on workarounds for sharing vaults and passwords in the event that we run out of 1Password licences, and we are unable to [recycle inactive user accounts](https://runbooks.operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services/1password/1password-inactive-users.html).

## Workaround 1 - Guest access to a vault

This option allows a user with Manager permissions on a vault to share a single vault with a "Guest" user. The user doesn't require a licence, but can only access a single vault at any one time. The organisation has a limit of ten "Guest" users.

## Workaround 2 - Sharing individual passwords via secure link

This option allows you to share a secure link for a single item from a vault to a users for a fixed period of time, after which the link is no longer available.

Full guidance for both workarounds can be found in 1Password user documentation - [How to share passwords with people outside your team](https://1password.com/resources/guides/sharing-passwords-with-guests/).
