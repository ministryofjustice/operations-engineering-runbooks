- User's details

## User triggered recovery requests

We will receive a notification that a user has triggered the recovery process in our #operations-engineering-alerts slack channel.

1. Click on the notification link to be taken to 1Password.

2. Follow the [Complete Recovery guidance](https://support.1password.com/recovery/#complete-recovery)

Notifications for any subsequent actions will be posted to the #operations-engineering-alerts Slack channel.
