# Renovate

Renovate is similiar to Dependabot whereby it keeps source code dependencies up to date by scanning package manager files and then raising automated Pull Requests for updating versions.

## Add/Remove a repository

To add a repository to renovate:

1.  Go to the [Renovate App](https://github.com/organizations/ministryofjustice/settings/installations/24703049)
2.  Scroll down to 'Repository Access'
3.  Click on "Select Repository' and find the repository to be added.
4.  Click on it to add it to the repository list and then click 'Save'.

To remove a repository, find it in the list, click on the 'X' next to the repository name and then click 'Save'.
