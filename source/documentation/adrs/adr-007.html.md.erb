# ADR-007 Decomission Developer Portal

## Status

✅ Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering create a proof of concept deployment of [Backstage] as a potential developer portal.

## Decision

Currently there is no clear use case for such a service. Should that change, a service team should be created to ensure the portal works for all its intended uses.

## Consequences

Decomissioning of the developer portal namespace and archiving the repository.

[Backstage]: https://backstage.io/
