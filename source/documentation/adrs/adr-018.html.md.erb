# ADR-018 Standardisation of Repository Naming for Operations Engineering

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

The Operations Engineering (OE) team at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) recognised the need for a standardised approach to naming our repositories to improve clarity, organisation, and navigability. Discussions revealed the importance of differentiating between repositories the team owns and those it acts as a custodian for within the broader organisation.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a dual approach to our repository naming conventions:

1. **Owned Repositories**: Repositories exclusively developed, managed, and used by the OE team will follow the `operations-engineering-*` naming convention. These are primarily internal tools, scripts, or resources utilised by our team.

2. **Custodian Repositories**: For repositories where the OE team acts as a custodian for the entire MoJ, a more generic and descriptive naming convention will be used. These names will not include the `operations-engineering-` prefix to ensure they are perceived as organisation-wide resources rather than team-specific.

## Consequences

- Owned repositories will be renamed, ensuring minimal disruption and clear communication within the MoJ.
- Custodian repositories will retain their current names or be named descriptively to reflect their use across the MoJ.
- Clear guidelines will be established to categorise repositories as either owned or custodian.
- The OE team will explore effective ways to track and manage our repository estate, respecting the dual nature of our responsibilities.
