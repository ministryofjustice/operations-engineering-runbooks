# ADR-010 1Password Manager Permissions

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering manages the 1Password organisation for the MoJ. 1Password Groups have a Manager role that allows that user to add people to the Group without requesting anything from Operations Engineering.

The main question that needed to be answered before allowing this permission to be assigned was:

\*\*What exactly does this allow the User to do?

The answer to this question was essentially nothing other than Management of the actual Group itself, they can not access Org or Billing settings whatsoever.

## Decision

Allow the existing Group Owner to have the Manager permission

## Consequences

Groups could get messy as we are not directly managing them
