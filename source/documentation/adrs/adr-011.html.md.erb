# ADR-011 GitHub Features as Opt In

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

Operations Engineering maintain a number of custom GitHub features that users can use in various ways across the development lifecycle.

All new GitHub features will be opt-in. We won't push any services on users unless they choose to enable them. Each feature will have its own opt-in mechanism designed for its specific use. This approach is based on user research, ensuring that users have control over their GitHub experience.

## Decision

All new GitHub features will be opt-in unless required otherwise

## Consequences

Uptake of said features may be low
