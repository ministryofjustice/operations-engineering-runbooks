# ADR-013: Archiving the DNS repo

## Status

❌ Rejected

## Context

The [DNS repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dns) has historically held the following:

- A dump of the dsd.io and justice.gov.uk hosted zones in Route53
- Tooling to register domains on bulk
- Tooling to maintain defensive domains

The repository has not been in use for over a year now and is very out of date.

## Decision

In the goal to keep the Ministry of Justice GitHub and domain estate clean, the decision has been made to archive the DNS repo as it no longer holds any purpose to the running of the DNS estate.

## Consequences

Although very out of date, there are various lists that could be used by users to find out infomation on domains and defensive domains.

## Trade-offs

Users will now have to find out any infomation they found previously from these (out of date) lists by other means, such as:

- Asking Operations Engineering
- Using the DNS IAC repo

## Next Steps

To complete this initiative, we will:

- Archive the DNS repo
